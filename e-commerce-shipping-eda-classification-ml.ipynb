From the charts and table above, we can infer that:\n1. Warehouse block F resulted the highest number of late orders. It is understandable as it handled the highest number of orders, and this might due to the lack of workforce in warehouse block F inefficient workflow or lack of facilities to ease the work of the staff. Anyhow, more investigation and visit to warehouse block F needed to determine real issue of the high number of late orders.\n2. If we only look at the data from the warehouse block A to D (warehouse E does not exist), we can clearly see that warehouse block A resulted the highest number of 'low importance' late orders, while warehouse block B resulted the highest number of 'medium importance' late orders and warehouse block A resulted the highest number of 'high importance' late orders.\n3. Warehouse block A resulted a relatively high number of highly important but late orders (111), which is 18.02% [111/ 616*100] out of the total late but highly important orders (616). \n4. The table above also showed that warehouse block A  resulted the highest percentage of late but highly important order (6.06% @ 165/1833*100) in proportion of the total orders that the warehouse block A handled. Besides, warehouse block A handled 165 highly important orders but 111 of them were late for arrival, which is 67.27%. Hence, it is suggested to check whether warehouse block A is taking the make an evaluation on the workflow in warehouse block A or check the distance between warehouse block A to destination to determine whether warehouse block A is always to far locations.
